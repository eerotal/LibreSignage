               Docker images.
  - [bugfix]   Fix a bug that prevented removing slide assets that didn't
               have a thumbnail.
  - [internal] Improve display animation performance by optimizing
               CSS and JavaScript. Browsers are now also hinted to use

               reinstalling.
  - [feature]  Implement a live slide preview in the editor.

               like including binary files in the GIT tree but I don't
               know of a better way so the font files are now included
               in the tree.)

               'data/' directory were accessible by requesting the
               different files with eg. a web browser. Even directory
               listings were enabled.
  - [feature]  Completely rewrite the markup transpiler system to
               improve its error detecting and reporting capabilities.
               The rewrite also introduced many other improvements. The
               transpiler now uses the familiar lexer-parser-evaluator
               architecture that most compilers use.

               code lines are now highlighted in the editor input.
