1. Introduction
---------------

Digital Signage is everything from large-scale commercial billboards
to smaller advertisement displays, notice boards or digital restaurant
menus. The possibilities of digital signage are endless. If you need
to display periodically changing content to users on a wall-mounted
TV for example, digital signage is probably what you are looking for.

LibreSignage is a free and open source, lightweight and easy-to-use
digital signage solution for use in schools, cafÃ©s, restaurants and
shops among others. LibreSignage can be used to manage a network of
digital signage displays. Don't let the word network fool you though;
a network can be as small as one display on an office wall or as big
as 50+ displays spread throughout a larger building.

LibreSignage also includes multi-user support with password authentication
and configurable access control to specific features. If a school wants
to setup a digital notice board system for example, they might give
every teacher an account with slide editing permissions so that teachers
could manage the content on the internal digital signage network. This
way the teachers could inform students about important things such as
upcoming tests for example.

LibreSignage uses a HTTP web server to serve content to the individual
signage displays. This means that the displays only need to run a web
browser pointed to the central LibreSignage server to actually display
content. This approach has a few advantages.

1. It's simple - No specific hardware/software platform is required.
   Any system with a fairly recent web browser works.
2. It's cheap - You don't necessarily need to buy lots of expensive
   equipment to get started. Just dust off the old PC in the closet,
   install an up-to-date OS like Linux on it, install a web browser,
   hide the mouse pointer by default and connect the system to a
   display. That's it. The only other thing you need is the server,
   which in fact can run on the same system if needed.
3. It's reliable - The web infrastructure is already implemented and
   well tested so why not use it.
4. It makes editing easy - Displaying content in a browser has the
   advantage of making slide previewing very simple. You can either
   use the 'Live Preview' in the editor or check the exact results
   from the actual 'Display' page that's displayed on the clients too.

2. Features
-----------

* Web interface for editing slides and managing the LibreSignage instance.
* Many per slide settings like durations, transitions, etc.
* Special markup syntax for easily formatting slides.
* Live preview of the slide markup in the slide editor.
* Support for embedding remote or uploaded image and video files.
* Support for scheduling specific slides for a specific time-frame.
* Collaboration features with other users on the network.
* Separate slide queues for different sets of signage clients.
* Multi user support with configurable access control.
* User management features for admin users in the web interface.
* Configurable quota for the amount of slides a user can create.
* Rate limited API for reducing server load.
* Extensive documentation of features including docs for developers.
* Extensive configuration possibilities.

3. Project goals
----------------

* Create a lightweight alternative to other digital signage solutions.
* Create a system that's both easy to set up and easy to use.
* Write a well documented and modular API so that implementing new
  user interfaces is simple.
* Avoid scope creep.
* Document all features.
* Keep it simple.

4.2. Using prebuilt Docker images on any distribution
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can easily deploy a containerized LibreSignage instance using the
LibreSignage Docker images from Docker Hub. The LibreSignage Docker
repository `eerotal/libresignage` contains the following images:

* **eerotal/libresignage:latest  - (Recommended) The latest stable image.**
* eerotal/libresignage:nightly   - The latest development build. This image
                                   is built from the `next` branch every night
                                   at 00:00.
* eerotal/libresignage:<version> - The current and all prevous stable releases.
                                   If you want to use the latest stable release,
                                   prefer the `latest` tag instead. `<version>`
                                   is the version number of the release.

The steps required to run a LibreSignage Docker image are listed below.

1. Install `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ if it's not installed yet.
2. Run the following command::

       docker run \
           -d \
           -p 80:80 \
           --mount source=ls_vol,target=/var/www/html/data \
           eerotal/libresignage:latest

   This command pulls the latest stable LibreSignage image from Docker Hub,
   binds port 80 on the host system to the container's port 80 (*-p*) and
   creates a volume *ls_vol* for storing LibreSignage data (*--mount*).
   `eerotal/libresignage:latest` is the image to run. Replace the tag after
   `:` to run a different image. *You might need to prefix the above command
   with `sudo` depending on your system configuration.*
3. Navigate to *localhost* and you should see the LibreSignage login
   page. The file *src/docs/rst/docker.rst* in the LibreSignage source
   distribution contains a more detailed explanation of using the
   LibreSignage Docker image. The documentation can also be accessed in
   the web interface from the *Help* page.

4.3. Building from source
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

4.3.1. Building a native build on Debian or Ubuntu
..................................................

Building LibreSignage from source isn't too difficult. You can build
a native LibreSignage build that runs directly on a Debian or Ubuntu
host (ie. no containers) by following the instructions below.

1. Install software needed for building LibreSignage. You will need the
   following packages: ``git, apache2, php, php-gd, pandoc, npm, composer,
   make, rsvg-convert``. All other packages except *npm* can be
   installed from the distribution repos by running ``sudo apt update && sudo
   apt install -y git apache2 php php-gd pandoc composer make librsvg2-bin``.
   You can install NPM by following the instructions on the
   `node.js website <https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/>`_.

   * If you want to enable video thumbnail generation, you need to install
     *ffmpeg* too. You can do that by running ``sudo apt install -y ffmpeg``.

   * If you want to run the PHPUnit unit tests you need to install the php-xml
     extension. You can do that by running ``sudo apt install -y php-xml``.

   * If you want to generate Doxygen documentation for LibreSignage, you
     need to install Doxygen. You can do that by running
     ``sudo apt install -y doxygen``

   See the section `4.1. Minimum system requirements`_ for more info.
2. Use ``cd`` to move to the directory where you want to download the
   LibreSignage repository.
3. Run ``git clone https://github.com/eerotal/LibreSignage.git``.
   The repository will be cloned into the directory *LibreSignage/*.
4. Run ``cd LibreSignage`` to move into the LibreSignage repository.
5. Run ``make configure TARGET=apache2-debian-interactive``. This target
   installs any needed *composer* and *npm* dependencies first and then
   prompts you for some configuration values:

   * Install directory [default: /var/www]

     * The directory where LibreSignage is installed. A subdirectory
       is created in this directory.

   * Server domain [default: localhost]

     * The domain name to use for configuring apache2. If you
       don't have a domain and you are just testing the system,
       you can either use 'localhost', your machines LAN IP or
       a test domain you don't actually own. If you use a test
       domain, you can add it to your */etc/hosts* file to make
       it work on your machine.

   * Domain aliases [default: ]

     * Domain name aliases for the server. Aliases make it possible
       to have the server respond from multiple domains. One useful
       way to use name aliases is to set *localhost* as the main
       domain and the LAN IP of the server as an alias. This would
       make it possible to connect to the server either by navigating
       to *localhost* on the host machine or by connecting to the LAN
       IP on the local network.

   * Admin name [default: Example Admin]

     * Shown to users on the main page as contact info in case of
       any problems.

   * Admin email [default: admin@example.com]

     * Shown to users on the main page as contact info in case of
       any problems.

   * Enable image thumbnail generation? (Y/N/y/n) [default: N]

     * Enable image thumbnail generation on the server. Currently
       image thumbnails are only generated for uploaded slide
       media. This option only works if the PHP GD extension is
       installed and enabled. You can check whether it's enabled
       by running ``php -m``. If *gd* is in the printed list, it
       is enabled. If *gd* doesn't appear in the list but is
       installed, you can run ``sudo phpenmod gd`` to enable it.

   * Enable video thumbnail generation? (Y/N/y/n) [default: N]

     * Enable video thumbnail generation. Currently video thumbnails
       are only generated for uploaded slide media. **Note that video
       thumbnail generation requires ffmpeg and ffprobe to be
       available on the host system.** If you enable this option,
       you'll also need to configure the binary paths to *ffmpeg*
       and *ffprobe* in the LibreSignage configuration files. The
       paths default to */usr/bin/ffmpeg* and */usr/bin/ffprobe*.
       See the help page `Libresignage configuration` or the file
       `src/doc/rst/configuration.rst` for more info.

   * Enable debugging? (Y/N/y/n) [default: N]

     *  Whether to enable debugging. This enables things like
        verbose error reporting through the API etc. **DO NOT
        enable debugging on production systems.**

   This command generates a build configuration file needed
   for building LibreSignage. The file is saved in ``build/`` as
   ``<DOMAIN>.conf`` where ``<DOMAIN>`` is the domain name you
   specified.
6. Run ``make -j$(nproc)`` to build LibreSignage. See `8. Makefile`_
   for more advanced make usage.
7. Finally, to install LibreSignage, run ``sudo make install`` and answer
   the questions asked.
8. Disable the default Apache site by running
   ``sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf``.
9. Navigate to the domain name you entered and you should see the
   LibreSignage login page.

4.3.2. Building a Docker image on Debian or Ubuntu
..................................................

You can build LibreSignage Docker images by following the instructions
below.

1. Follow the steps 1-5 from `4.3.1. Building a native build on Debian
   or Ubuntu`_.
2. Install `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ if it isn't yet installed.
3. Run the following command::

       make configure \
           TARGET=apache2-debian-docker \
           PASS="--features [features]"

   Where ``[features]`` is a comma separated list of features to enable.
   The recognized features are:

   * imgthumbs = Image thumbnail generation using *PHP gd*.
   * vidthumbs = Video thumbnail generation using *ffmpeg*.
   * debug     = Debugging.

4. Run ``make`` to build the LibreSignage distribution.
5. Run ``make install`` to package LibreSignage in a Docker image.
   This will take some time as Docker needs to download a lot of stuff.
   After this command has completed the LibreSignage image is saved in
   your machine's Docker registry as *libresignage:[version]*. You can
   use it by following the instructions in `4.2. Using prebuilt Docker
   images on any distribution`_.

Extra
*****

 You can also build LibreSignage Docker images automatically using the
 helper script *build/helpers/docker/build_img.sh*. If you want to build
 a release image just run the script. If you want to build a development
 image, pass *dev* as the first argument.

 The *build/helpers/docker/* directory also contains the script
 *run_dev.sh* for starting a development/testing docker container.

5. Default users
----------------

The default users and their groups and passwords are listed below.
It goes without saying that you should create new users and change
the passwords if you intend to use LibreSignage on a production
system.

=========== ======================== ==========
    User             Groups           Password
=========== ======================== ==========
admin        admin, editor, display   admin
user         editor, display          user
display      display                  display
=========== ======================== ==========


6. FAQ
------

Why doesn't LibreSignage use framework/library X?
  To avoid bloat; LibreSignage is designed to be minimal and lightweight
  and it only uses external libraries where they are actually needed.
  Most UI frameworks for example are huge. LibreSignage does use
  Bootstrap though, since it's a rather clean and simple framework.

Why doesn't LibreSignage have feature X?
  You can suggest new features in the bug tracker. If you know a bit
  about programming in PHP, JS, HTML and CSS, you can also implement
  the feature yourself and create a pull request.

Is LibreSignage really free?
  YES! In fact LibreSignage is not only free, it's also open source.
  You can find information about the LibreSignage license in the
  section `12. License`_.

8. Makefile
-----------

8.1. Targets
++++++++++++

The following ``make`` targets are implemented.

all
  The default rule that builds the LibreSignage distribution. You
  can pass ``NOHTMLDOCS=y`` if you don't want to generate any HTML
  documentation.

configure
  Generate a LibreSignage build configuration file. You need to use
  ``TARGET=[target]`` to select a build target to use. You can also
  optionally use ``PASS=[pass]`` to pass any target specific arguments
  to the build configuration script. See `9. Build targets`_ for more info.

configure-build
  Generate a LibreSignage build configuration file. You need to pass
  ``TARGET=[target]`` to select a build target to use. You can also optionally
  use ``PASS=[pass]`` to pass any target specific arguments to the build
  configuration script. See `9. Build targets`_ for more info. **You don't need
  to run this target because the configure target runs this one aswell.**

configure-system
  Generate LibreSignage system configuration files. **You don't need to run
  this target because the configure target runs this one aswell.**

install
  Install the LibreSignage distribution on the system. Note that
  the meaning of install depends on the target you are building for.
  Running ``make install`` for the *apache2-debian-docker* target,
  for example, builds the Docker image (ie. installs LibreSignage into
  the Docker image).

clean
  Clean files generated by building LibreSignage.

realclean
  Same as *clean* but removes all generated files and build config files
  too. This rule effectively resets the LibreSignage directory to how it
  was right after cloning the repo.

test-api
  Run the API integration tests. Note that you must install LibreSignage
  first. The API URI can be set by changing the value of ``PHPUNIT_API_HOST``.
  See below for more info.

doxygen-docs
  Build the Doxygen documentation for LibreSignage. The docs are output in
  the ``doxygen_docs/`` directory.

LOC
  Count the lines of code in LibreSignage.

8.2. Option variables
+++++++++++++++++++++

You can also pass some other variables to the LibreSignage makefile.

CONF=<config file> - (default: Last generated config.)
  Use a specific build configuration file when building or installing
  LibreSignage. This option can be used with the targets *all* and
  *install*.

VERBOSE=<Y/n>
  Print verbose log output. This setting can be used with any target.

INITCHK_WARN=<y/N>
  Don't abort the build process if one of the initialization checks fails.
  If this is set to Y, only a warning is printed. This option can be used
  for example when an incompatible dependency version is used but the user
  wants to try building LibreSignage with that version anyway.

PHPUNIT_API_HOST=<URI>
  Use *URI* as the hostname when running API integration tests. This is
  ``http://localhost:80/`` by default.

9. Build targets
----------------

* apache2-debian

  * A target for building a native install on Debian with Apache2.
  * Run ``make configure TARGET=apache2-debian PASS="--help"`` to
    get a list of accepted CLI options.

* apache2-debian-interactive

  * An interactive version of *apache2-debian*.
  * This target doesn't accept any CLI options.

* apache2-debian-docker (Build target for building Docker images.)

  * A target for building Docker images.
  * Run ``make configure TARGET=apache2-debian-docker PASS="--help"`` to
    get a list of accepted CLI options.

10. Documentation
-----------------

LibreSignage documentation is written in reStructuredText, which is
a plaintext format often used for writing technical documentation.
The reStructuredText syntax is also human-readable as-is, so you can
read the documentation files straight from the source tree. The docs
are located in the directory *src/doc/rst/*.

The reStructuredText files are also compiled into HTML when LibreSignage
is built and they can be accessed from the *Help* page of LibreSignage.
