	[p]This screen is one of the default screens supplied with LibreSignage. If you see this
        screen and you are the admin of this instance, the server installation is now
        finished. Now it's time to add some real content to the system and start using it.[/p]

	[p]If you are not the admin of this LibreSignage instance and you see this screen,
        you should probably contact the server admin. Either the server setup is still in
        progress or something has gone wrong with the LibreSignage instance.[/p]
